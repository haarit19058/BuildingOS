If you're interested in **writing an OS for the Raspberry Pi**, here's a curated set of **high-quality resources**—tutorials, guides, courses, and community references—to kickstart your journey:

---

### Official Tutorials & Hands-On Guides

* **Baking Pi – Operating Systems Development** (Cambridge University): A beginner-friendly series that walks you through developing OS features in ARM assembly for Raspberry Pi (LEDs, screen, input) ([Computer Laboratory][1]).

* **rpi4-osdev: Bare-Metal Raspberry Pi 4 Tutorial**: A comprehensive GitHub-based tutorial that guides you from setting up cross-compiling to bootable kernel creation on real hardware ([rpi4os.com][2]).

---

### Community Tutorials & Projects

* **Rust Raspberry Pi OS Tutorials**: An elegant, **Rust-based** step-by-step series showing how to build a monolithic kernel for Raspberry Pi 3 & 4—covering serial output, virtual memory, exception handling, and more ([GitHub][3]).

* **s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os**: A structured OS development guide that parallels simple Raspberry Pi kernel features with Linux internals for each learning unit ([GitHub][4]).

---

### OSDev Wiki & Minimal Examples

* **Raspberry Pi Bare Bones** (OSDev Wiki): A lean tutorial to create a minimal kernel in C (or Rust), covering cross-compilation, bootflow, linking, and running on QEMU or real Pi hardware ([OSDev Wiki][5]).

---

### Video Tutorials

[Raspberry Pi Bare Metal Tutorial - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd9AVmcRc6U&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

A visual walkthrough to help you get started with bare-metal OS development on Raspberry Pi. Great for seeing initial steps live in action.

---

### Structured Courses

* **Udemy: “Write Your Own Operating System Step by Step”**: A hands-on course teaching you how to craft a 64-bit OS for Raspberry Pi 3 & 4—covering ARM64 fundamentals, interrupts, paging, process scheduling, system calls, basic filesystem, and console interface ([Udemy][6]).

---

### Community & Additional References

* **OSDev Community & Wiki**: A treasure trove of tutorials, FAQs, and user contributions for hobbyist OS development ([Wikipedia][7]).

* **StackExchange Q\&A**: Practical advice around using C in OS development for Raspberry Pi: setting up the stack, interrupts, memory controllers, and more ([Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange][8]).
