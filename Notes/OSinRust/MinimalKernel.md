That `"data-layout"` string in a Rust target JSON is essentially a **blueprint of how the compiler should lay out data in memory** for your target architecture — it’s a dense, LLVM-specific encoding of endianness, pointer sizes, integer widths, float alignments, and so on.

It’s passed **directly to LLVM**, so its syntax comes from LLVM’s [DataLayout string format](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#datalayout).

Let’s break down yours:

```
e-m:e-p270:32:32-p271:32:32-p272:64:64-i64:64-i128:128-f80:128-n8:16:32:64-S128
```

---

### **1. Endianness**

```
e
```

* `e` = little-endian
* `E` would mean big-endian.

---

### **2. Mangling style**

```
m:e
```

* `m:` sets the symbol name mangling scheme.
* `e` here means ELF-style name mangling (used on Linux, bare-metal ELF targets, etc.).

---

### **3. Pointer sizes and alignments**

```
p270:32:32
p271:32:32
p272:64:64
```

Each `pXYZ:A:B` means:

* `pXYZ` → address space number (default is 0, but here it’s 270–272, which are special GPU/embedded address spaces; Pi bare-metal uses them for MMIO separation in some LLVM configs).
* First number (`A`) = pointer size in bits.
* Second number (`B`) = pointer alignment in bits.

So:

* `p270:32:32` = pointers in address space 270 are 32-bit, aligned to 32 bits.
* `p271:32:32` = same for address space 271.
* `p272:64:64` = address space 272 uses 64-bit pointers, 64-bit aligned.

---

### **4. Integer sizes/alignments**

```
i64:64
i128:128
```

* `i64:64` → 64-bit integers have 64-bit alignment.
* `i128:128` → 128-bit integers have 128-bit alignment.

---

### **5. Floating-point sizes/alignments**

```
f80:128
```

* 80-bit floating point (`long double` on some platforms) is aligned to 128 bits.
  (Mostly legacy x87 behavior — not really used on ARM but carried over from LLVM defaults.)

---

### **6. Native integer widths**

```
n8:16:32:64
```

* The architecture can efficiently handle 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integers.

---

### **7. Stack alignment**

```
S128
```

* Natural stack alignment is 128 bits (16 bytes).
* Important for SIMD (NEON) and AArch64 ABI compliance.

---

✅ **Summary**:
This tells LLVM:

* Use **little-endian** memory ordering.
* ELF symbol mangling.
* Special pointer sizes for different address spaces (some 32-bit, some 64-bit).
* Align 64-bit ints to 8 bytes, 128-bit ints to 16 bytes.
* Support efficient 8/16/32/64-bit ints.
* Keep the stack 16-byte aligned.

---

If you want, I can **decode the Pi 5’s actual `data-layout`** from LLVM so we can put the exact correct string in your `aarch64` target JSON — that way you don’t have to guess.
Do you want me to do that?
