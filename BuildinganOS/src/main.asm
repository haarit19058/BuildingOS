; What is a section in assembly language
;  It is a logical block in our program that tells the assembler how to group code and data
; .text - for code 
; .data - for initialzied data
;  .bss - for uninitialized data

;  in boot loader you often dont use thse nromal sections instead you just tell teh assembler exactly where your code will be loaded with or





; How the BIOS finds and starts an OS:
;  - During startup, BIOS runs POST (Power-On Self Test) to check hardware.
;  - It reads the boot order from CMOS/BIOS settings.
;  - For each bootable device in order:
;       * Reads the first sector (512 bytes) into memory at address 0x7C00.
;       * Checks the last two bytes for the boot signature 0x55 0xAA (in that order).
;       * If signature is valid, jumps to 0x7C00 and executes the loaded code.
;  - That first sector is called the "Master Boot Record" (MBR) or "Boot Sector".
;  - The boot sector codeâ€™s job is to load the rest of the OS or another boot stage.


; EFI
; BIOS looks into special EFI paritions
;  operating systems must be compiled as an EFI program



; Bios always puts our os at address 7c00 so first we will give our asslembler this information

; Tells the assembler where we expect our code to be loaded 
org 0x7C00

; Directives vs Instructions:
; - Directive: Assembler-only commands (assembly time). Control code/data layout,
;              define constants, allocate storage. Not executed by CPU.
; - Instruction: Actual CPU operations (runtime). Translated into machine code
;                and executed by the processor (e.g., mov, add, jmp).


; tells teh assembler to emit 16 bit code for backward compatibilti
bits 16

; Memory Segmentation
; RAM memory
; 80_86 proc have adress bus of 20 bits this means that you could access upto a total of 2^20 bits ~ 64kb
; But using memory segmentation you can access upto 1MiB of memory

; segmetn : offset
;  each segmetn contains 64 kb f memor and each of them can be accessed using offset value
;  Real addr = segment * 16 + offset

;  Special registers are used to specify currently active segments
; CS- currently running code segment
;  DS - data segment
; SS - stack segment
;  ES,FS,GS - extra (data) segments
